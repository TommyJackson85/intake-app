# PRIVACY POLICY

## How long we keep your data

We keep personal data only for as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or to comply with legal, accounting or reporting requirements.

In practice, this means:

- **Marketing leads** (law firms that submit their details on our website) are kept for **2 years** from the last interaction, unless you unsubscribe or ask us to delete them earlier.
- **User and firm account data** (such as profiles, firm details and subscription information) are kept for the **lifetime of the firm’s subscription** and for **1 year after the account is closed**, so that we can deal with queries, disputes or reactivation requests.
- **Client and matter data** that we host on behalf of law firms is kept **for as long as the firm’s account remains active and in line with the firm’s own retention settings**, which by default is **6 years after a matter is closed**, unless the firm configures a different period.
- **AML / KYC‑related records and audit logs** (for example AML flags, risk assessments and access logs) are kept for **7 years** to help our customers meet their legal and regulatory obligations and to maintain an accountability trail.
- **Backups** of our database are kept for approximately **90 days** on a rolling basis and are then automatically overwritten; we cannot delete or modify individual records in historical backups, but if a backup is restored we will re‑apply our current deletion rules to that environment.

When the applicable retention period expires, we either delete the data or anonymise it so that it can no longer be linked to an identifiable person. We may keep data for longer if required by law or where necessary to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.

More detail on our data categories and retention periods is available in our **Data Map & GDPR Compliance Document**, which we can provide on request.
