# DPA – DATA RETENTION / DELETION CLAUSE

## Data Retention and Deletion

### 1. Retention during the term

The Processor will retain Customer Personal Data only for as long as necessary to provide the Services under the Agreement and to comply with applicable law, in accordance with the retention periods set out in Annex [X] (Data Retention Schedule).

### 2. Default retention periods

Unless the Controller configures different retention periods using the features of the Services (where available) or instructs otherwise in writing, the Processor will apply the following default retention periods:

- **Marketing leads** collected via the Processor’s website: **2 years** from the last interaction with the lead.
- **User and firm account data** (including profiles, firm information and subscription details): for the **duration of the subscription** and for **1 year after termination** of the Agreement.
- **Client and matter data** processed on behalf of the Controller: **6 years after matter closure** by default, or such other period as the Controller configures within the Services or instructs in writing, subject to applicable law.
- **AML / KYC‑related records and audit logs** (including access logs): **7 years** from the date of creation, or such longer period as may be required by applicable anti‑money‑laundering or professional‑conduct rules.
- **Backups**: database backups are stored on a rolling basis for approximately **90 days**, after which they are automatically overwritten in the normal course of operations.

### 3. Deletion on termination

Within **[30/60] days** after termination or expiry of the Services, the Processor will delete or irreversibly anonymise Customer Personal Data in its active systems, unless applicable law requires longer storage or the Controller requests in writing that data be exported prior to deletion.

### 4. Backups and legal holds

Customer Personal Data stored in backups will be deleted through automatic backup rotation within approximately **90 days**. The Processor will not actively restore or access such backups except where necessary for security, business continuity or legal purposes; if a backup is restored, the Processor will re‑apply the applicable deletion and retention rules to the restored environment. Where the Controller informs the Processor that certain data is subject to a legal hold or statutory retention requirement, the Processor will retain that data for as long as instructed, provided such instructions are lawful and technically feasible.

### 5. Deletion at the Controller’s request

During the term of the Agreement, the Controller may use the functionality of the Services or submit written instructions to delete or anonymise specific Customer Personal Data (for example to respond to a data‑subject request). The Processor will act on such instructions without undue delay, unless retention is required by Union or Member State law or is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
